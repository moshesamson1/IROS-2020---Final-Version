This paper introduces the {\em competitive coverage} problem, a new variant of the robotic coverage problem in which a robot \rob competes with another robot \opp in order to be the first to cover an area. In the variant discussed in this paper, the {\em asymmetric competitive coverage}, \opp is unaware of the existence of \rob, which attempts to take that fact into consideration in order to succeed in being the first to cover as many parts of the environment as possible. We consider different information models of \rob, that define how much it knows about the location of \opp and its planned coverage path. We present an optimal algorithm for \rob in the full-information case, and show that unless \rob has information about \opp's initial location, it is as if it has no information at all. Lastly, we describe a correlation between the time it takes \rob to reach \opp's initial location and the coverage paths quality, and present a heuristic algorithm for the case in which \rob has information only about \opp's initial location, showing its superiority compared to other coverage algorithms in rigorous simulation experiments.
